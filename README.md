Our code was developed via Live Share in VS Code, meaning the person that commits is not meaningful.
Both students contributed equally to the code.

# Repository overview

## Project 1: Diabetic Retinopathy Detection
The folder diabetic_retinopathy_detection contains all code to run the classification algorithm. More information in the readme inside the folder.

## Project 2: Great Barrier Reef - Starfish Detection
The folder GBR_starfish_detection contains all code to run the detection algorithm. More information in the readme inside the folder.

## Project 2b: Traffic Cone Detection
Because the starfish dataset was quite challenging, the YOLO network was also trained and evaluated on a traffic cone dataset. Because the data format is different and to keep the projects separate, this dataset was handled in a separate folder.

## Documentation
The folder documentation contains the presentation and poster incl. source files of the starfish detection project and the paper incl. source files of the diabetic retinopathy detection project.
